\item[Integrand] is a function used to calculate an integral.

\item[Quadratic] comes from quadratus, which is the Latin word for ``square.''

\item[polynomial] is a formula with many terms, each with a

                  coefficient (\bf Nomial \rm = name of a term, and
                  \bf Poly \rm = many).


                  This is a polynomial: $3x^2 + 3x + 5$

                  This is not: $3x^2 + 3/x + 5$ (because of the $3/x$
                  (thats like $3x^{-1}$, instead of $3x$)



\item[Coefficient] is the constant multiplicative factor of a specific
object

        In $3x^2$, 3 is the coefficient.
